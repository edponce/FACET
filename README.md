For this project, and all projects which fall under the scope of NLP/IE, we will be handling our version control with a particular git workflow in mind.  Prior to contributing to this project please make yourself familiar with the workflow description which can be found [here](workflow-link).  Also checkout [this link][git-flow-avh] for a CLI tool that will handle lots of the details of this workflow in git.
