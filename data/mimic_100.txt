Narrative / Plan:
I met with the patient and her 2 daughters to discuss DC plans and
their choices for rehab placement.  I informed them that I was called
by xxhosp Hospital and xxhosp and they are not going to make bed
offers.  I discussed the need for ongoing rehab care given Ms. xxln
de-conditioned state and that given that de-conditioning, a home
discharge was not a safe discharge.  We discussed LTAC facilities in
and around the xxloc area.  We discussed why this type of facility was
preferable for rehab and I identified which facilities offered this
type of care.  Those facilities are as follows:  NE xxhosp at xxdocln,
xxhosp, xxhosp-xxloc and xxhosp Rehab-MACU.  NE xxhosp has
already screened the patient and has medically accepted her.  I will
call all the remaining facilities in am of 2/ 7.  The patient still
needs a PT eval and medication adjustment before she is ready for
transfer.  I will continue to follow.

Narrative / Plan:
I met briefly with the patient's husband, xxname xxname, and more
extensively with her 2 sisters.  I wanted to introduce the discharge
planning process for a patient with a tracheostomy when they no longer
need ICU level of care.  The issues I have identified and that were
part of this discussion are as follows
1) Treatment setting for subsequent care,  meaning Acute rehab/LTAC,
Chronic Vent Facility, Home.
2) Where will the patient and family seek rehab placement (State):
xxstate, xxstate or xxstate;
3) Insurance approval for such a facility; Will the patient meet the
insurer's guidelines for acute rehab/LTAC placement?
4) Transport to the facility; Land versus Air ambulance and insurance
coverage for the transport.
I believe that Ms. xxname
sister's understood the plan as outlined
and I will have the same discussion with the patient's husband.  It is
uncertain when the patient will have her tracheostomy and she will
require 48 hours post tracheostomy before she can be accepted by a
facility here in xxstate.  I am tentatively planning for
discharge after Sunday, xxdate.  I will follow up with the team to let
them know my plan.

Narrative / Plan (Multidisciplinary team):
Contactxxname by ICU team regarding DC plans.  At the present time the
possibility of a transfer to xxhosp xxhosp Hospital is being
explored.  This plan involves a doctor to doctor referral from ICU at
xxhosp to an accepting physician at the desired facility.  This
possibility is in the process of being explored.  If the xxhosp
Hospital will accept the patient then the type of transportation to the
facility will be need to be discussed and arranged.  Since this
transfer is one that involves the family wishes and not because the
level of care provided here is insufficient, insurance payment may be
an issue.  All air transportation needs to be approved by her insurer,
or privately paid for by her family.  xxloc Med Flight does do these
transports.  Land transport does not seem feasible given her present
care requirements and the length of time to reach an out of state
destination.  If the transfer to xxstate is not possible and the plan
is for xxhosp rehab then the following are the outstanding issues that
need to be addressed.
1) What state does the family want as her destination?  xxstate,
xxstate, or xxstate.
2) What facilities within those states are capable of xxhosp
rehab?
3) When will the patient be ready for discharge?
4) Any rehab placement will need to be approved by her insurer.
5) How will the patient be transported to this facility once one has
been found, approved and a bed offer made?
6) Will transportation require prior authorization for land or air
ambulance if placement is in an out of state facility?
Given the holiday weekend there may be some delay associated with any
one of these questions and a weekend discharge to an acute rehab level
of care seems unlikely.

rehab treatment setting would be dependent on 2 factors, 1) Oncology
treatment plan 2) Physical therapist recommendations.  I offered the
names of 7 different facilities,  acute rehab possibilities are
xxhosp and NE xxhosp.  Short term rehab possibilities are:
xxhosp, xxfn xxln, xxhosp, xxloc at xxloc and

Dr. xxln, that land ambulance was previously mentioned by the ICU
attending but he felt whatever mode would be the quickest would be the
best. Therefore I have learned the following information:
Land Ambulance (xxloc) would involve an ACLS ambulance.  The base rate
is $650.00 and then $20.00 per mile.  Approximate mileage is 207 miles,
for a total of $4790.00.  Time to travel is estimated to be
4.5-5hours.  One person could accompany the patient sitting in the
front seat.
Air Ambulance door to door cost $6,448.08.   The patient would be
transported by land ambulance to their airport (30 minutes) Flight
would be approx. 40 minutes.  The flight would land at xxln and
travel by land ambulance to NY Presbyterian is estimated to be 1 hour.
Both modes of transport would require 24 hours notice.  There may be
weather related issues on Tuesday that could prevent an air ambulance
flight.  I will know more tomorrow. I have informed Mr. xxln of all
of the above information and he will contact me with his decision.

I have initiated a referral to Hospice of the xxloc today.  There
have been several discussion between myself and the Palliative Care
team regarding this patient
s desire to return home.  There was still a
sense from the patient that despite his statements about ending
aggressive treatment he was not quite at the Hospice election process.
I had informed the Hospice Provider that plans would likely move
forward on Monday.  I have re-contactxxname this agency and per their
request I will fax demographics and an documentation regarding the
patient
s desire for hospice.  This agency due to the lateness of the
hour on a Sunday afternoon would not be able to put the necessary
equipment and needed services into the home until Monday.  I have met
with the family and discussed this plan.  Their paramount concern is
for the patient
s comfort.  If we can can him home as well then they
would be grateful.  I will follow-up in am with ICU team and Hospice to
facilitate this discharge home as rapidly as possible.

contactxxname the Liaison for this facility and she has screened the
patient for potential placement.  The Liaison for HRC has asked for
clarification of her treatment goals as she has noted several
references in the patient's chart regarding Hospice.  The level of care
the patient is receiving would require placement in the MACU - acute
rehab.  Given this need and her severe deterioration physically and
medically they are questioning the approrpriateness of a Rehab
placement.  I have discussed this concern with the ICU Team and there
is a plan to discuss goals of care with the patient's daughter as soon

Narrative / Plan (Family, Multidisciplinary team, xxfn xxln, xxfn
xxln, of Palliative Care):
I have met with and telephonically conferenced with multiple members of
the family, ICU Team and Palliative Care.  Clinically there is very
little that can be done for this patient and she is actively dying.
xxfn xxln, her daughter and HCP does not see her mother in those
terms but chooses rather to see the gains she has made with treatment,
""She has gotten better"".  DC home with the patient needing frequent
xxln-tracheal suctioning (without a tracheostomy) is not a workable DC
option.  The family will not consider rehab placement as an alternative
setting.  I have discussed a time frame with the daughter and
identified xxname or Tuesday as the time when definitive plans will
need to be decided and implemented.  The ICU team may discuss the
placement of a tracheostomy so that suctioning can be done at home in a
safe manor, with the daughter.  One other obstacle has been xxfn
xxln
lack of communication when treatment decisions needs to be
made. There was a meeting planned for this am but xxfn xxln did
not attend and went to work instead.  Indeed, I had called her on xxmmdd
to have a discussion about DC plans and she never returned my call.
This has been a pattern throughout her mother's stay in the ICU.  My
last conversation with the Palliative Care team was that we would
revisit DC plans on xxmmdd with the goal of a plan to be set in motion
on xxmmdd.

plan is to place a call with the Hospice of the xxloc and
initiate a possible intake for Monday xxdate when the patient and his

Narrative / Plan (Multidisciplinary team):
Mr. xxname has tolerated the trach collar since xxmmdd. A family
meeting was held on that day w/ Mrs. xxln and her son xxname.
The family wishes to bring him home. Please see complete note from that
day in the ICU documentation. In summary it was recommended that xxdocfn
come in to the hospital as soon as possible to learn how to care for
his father. It has also been recommended that the family hire a nurse
to help with the transition home from the hospital. On xxmmdd xxdocfn
telephoned me and informed me he was not feeling well and wouldn't be
in to learn how to care for his father. xxname also told me that he
wouldn't be in on Saturday either because he had a wedding to attend.
The nursing staff reported they didn't any family on Sunday or Monday
either. Today (xxmmdd) xxfn xxln-xxln from xxhosp Hospice came in
to update the referral. She met w/ xxfn xxln and myself to discuss
the case. Ms. xxln has concerns with the plan for home
hospice due to the level of care that is required to care for Mr.
xxln. He does require at the minimum to be suctioned a minimum
of q 2-4hrs of thick secretions. Ms. xxln recommended that
Mr. xxln be admitted under GIP benefit to a facility once
discharged from the hospital as a transition to home. There is still
the financial risk once GIP stops paying to xxhosp or LTAC because he has
exhausted his all of his inpatient Medicare benefits. GIC does not have
any rehab benefits. Ms. xxln will arrange to meet w/ Mrs.
xxln and xxdocfn to discuss the plan. Updates have been given on
regular to xxfn xxln at GIC Indemnity Plan. She is well aware of
obstacles over discharge the family has been putting in place such as
cancelling or not showing up to family meetings, asking for time to
make decisions, not coming in to visit to avoid speaking to caregivers
and not answering the telephone.

their facility.  NE xxhosp has screened the patient and could make a bed
offer for today.  However, Mr. xxln is awaiting a decision from
xxhosp and will not consider placement elsewhere until he hears from
them. In addition, the patient's insurer has to review the request for
rehab placement with her xxhosp delegated provider review board before

know this patient will delay the review process until I can provided

Narrative / Plan (Multidisciplinary team):
Mr. xxln was screened for xxhosp Rehab MACU, xxhosp, xxloc Siani, Radius and xxhosp. Mr. xxname was not accepted to
any of the facilities. The reason they all gave was the patient has the
potential to be on the ventilator chronically and insurance issues. Due
to being in the hospital and rehabs for a prolonged period of time the
patient has exhausted all of hospital and rehab benefits through his
Medicare policy. He is now being covered by his secondary payer GIC.
The patient has an annual $10,000.00 deductable with his secondary
insurance which Mrs. xxln and his xxdocfn are well aware. The
family has already had to give another facility money up front before
transfer. The facilities are also concerned because MassHealth has not
been initiated or inplace as of this writing. The family has been
encourgaged several times by this writer and I was informed early on
Mrs. xxln was going to see an Attny who specializes in
MassHealth. It is true the spouse in the  community may have just under
$ 100,000 in convertable assests not including the primary residence or
the vehicle.
This write has been informed of the potential of the family bringing
the patient home. I would encourage if this is the case there be 24
nursing care in place when the patient is discharged for at least the
very beginning. It is also important to have the family in for several
consectutive days to perfom hands on care and teaching prior to
discharge to assess their level of compentency.
